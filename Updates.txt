If you'd like to upgrade early, ensure your Pi has network connectivity then:

demouser@pi64 ~ $ sudo emaint sync --repo sakaki-tools
demouser@pi64 ~ $ sudo emerge -v --update --oneshot app-portage/genup
demouser@pi64 ~ $ sudo genup

This will update your kernels, boot firmware and all affected userland packages (approximately 200 or so). Let it run to completion - although it will use binary packages from the binhost for almost all upgrades, it will still require three or so hours for everything.

Once finished (you see the message "All done - your system is now up to date!"), reboot, to start using the new kernel. Once back up, open a console and then issue:

demouser@pi64 ~ $ sudo dispatch-conf

Once you have completed the config file updates, reboot once more, and you should be at v1.5.1! You can check by issuing:

demouser@pi64 ~ $ eix rpi-64bit-meta
